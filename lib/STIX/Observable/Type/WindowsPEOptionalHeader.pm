=head1 NAME

STIX::Observable::Type::WindowsPEOptionalHeader - STIX Cyber-observable Object (SCO) - windows PE Optional Header Type

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use STIX::Observable::Type::WindowsPEOptionalHeader;

    my $windows_pe_optional_header_type = STIX::Observable::Type::WindowsPEOptionalHeader->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Windows PE Optional Header type represents the properties of the PE
optional header.


=head2 METHODS

L<STIX::Observable::Type::WindowsPEOptionalHeader> inherits all methods from L<STIX::Common::Properties>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item STIX::Observable::Type::WindowsPEOptionalHeader->new(%properties)

Create a new instance of L<STIX::Observable::Type::WindowsPEOptionalHeader>.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->address_of_entry_point

Specifies the address of the entry point relative to the image base when
the executable is loaded into memory.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->base_of_code

Specifies the address that is relative to the image base of the
beginning-of-code section when it is loaded into memory.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->base_of_data

Specifies the address that is relative to the image base of the
beginning-of-data section when it is loaded into memory.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->checksum_hex

Specifies the checksum of the PE binary.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->dll_characteristics_hex

Specifies the flags that characterize the PE binary.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->file_alignment

Specifies the factor (in bytes) that is used to align the raw data of
sections in the image file.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->hashes

Specifies any hashes that were computed for the optional header
(see L<STIX::Common::Hashes>).

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->image_base

Specifies the preferred address of the first byte of the image when loaded
into memory.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->loader_flags_hex

Specifies the reserved loader flags.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->magic_hex

Specifies the unsigned integer that indicates the type of the PE binary.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->major_image_version

Specifies the major version number of the image.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->major_linker_version

Specifies the linker major version number.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->major_os_version

Specifies the major version number of the required operating system.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->major_subsystem_version

Specifies the major version number of the subsystem.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->minor_image_version

Specifies the minor version number of the image.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->minor_linker_version

Specifies the linker minor version number.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->minor_os_version

Specifies the minor version number of the required operating system.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->minor_subsystem_version

Specifies the minor version number of the subsystem.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->number_of_rva_and_sizes

Specifies the number of data-directory entries in the remainder of the
optional header.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->section_alignment

Specifies the alignment (in bytes) of PE sections when they are loaded into
memory.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->size_of_code

Specifies the size of the code (text) section. If there are multiple such
sections, this refers to the sum of the sizes of each section.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->size_of_headers

Specifies the combined size of the MS-DOS, PE header, and section headers,
rounded up a multiple of the value specified in the file_alignment header.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->size_of_heap_commit

Specifies the size of the local heap space to commit.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->size_of_heap_reserve

Specifies the size of the local heap space to reserve.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->size_of_image

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the image, including all headers, as the
image is loaded in memory.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->size_of_initialized_data

Specifies the size of the initialized data section. If there are multiple
such sections, this refers to the sum of the sizes of each section.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->size_of_stack_commit

Specifies the size of the stack to commit.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->size_of_stack_reserve

Specifies the size of the stack to reserve

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->size_of_uninitialized_data

Specifies the size of the uninitialized data section. If there are multiple
such sections, this refers to the sum of the sizes of each section.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->subsystem_hex

Specifies the subsystem (e.g., GUI, device driver, etc.) that is required
to run this image.

=item $windows_pe_optional_header_type->win32_version_value_hex

Specifies the reserved win32 version value.
