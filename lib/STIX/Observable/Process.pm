=head1 NAME

STIX::Observable::Process - STIX Cyber-observable Object (SCO) - Process

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use STIX::Observable::Process;

    my $process = STIX::Observable::Process->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Process Object represents common properties of an instance of a
computer program as executed on an operating system.


=head2 METHODS

L<STIX::Observable::Process> inherits all methods from L<STIX::Observable>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item STIX::Observable::Process->new(%properties)

Create a new instance of L<STIX::Observable::Process>.

=item $process->child_refs

Specifies the other processes that were spawned by (i.e. children of) this
process, as a reference to one or more other Process Objects.

=item $process->command_line

Specifies the full command line used in executing the process, including
the process name (which may be specified individually via the
binary_ref.name property) and any arguments.

=item $process->created_time

Specifies the date/time at which the process was created.

=item $process->creator_user_ref

Specifies the user that created the process, as a reference to a User
Account Object.

=item $process->cwd

Specifies the current working directory of the process.

=item $process->environment_variables

Specifies the list of environment variables associated with the process as
a dictionary.

=item $process->extensions

The Process Object defines the following extensions. In addition to these,
producers MAY create their own. Extensions: windows-process-ext,
windows-service-ext.

=item $process->id

=item $process->image_ref

Specifies the executable binary that was executed as the process image, as
a reference to a File Object.

=item $process->is_hidden

Specifies whether the process is hidden.

=item $process->opened_connection_refs

Specifies the list of network connections opened by the process, as a
reference to one or more Network Traffic Objects.

=item $process->parent_ref

Specifies the other process that spawned (i.e. is the parent of) this one,
as represented by a Process Object.

=item $process->pid

Specifies the Process ID, or PID, of the process.

=item $process->type

The value of this property MUST be C<process>.

=head2 HELPERS

=over

=item $process->TO_JSON

Convert L<STIX::Observable::Process> object in JSON.

=item $process->to_string
