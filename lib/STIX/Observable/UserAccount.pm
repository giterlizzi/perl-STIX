=head1 NAME

STIX::Observable::UserAccount - STIX Cyber-observable Object (SCO) - User Account

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use STIX::Observable::UserAccount;

    my $user_account = STIX::Observable::UserAccount->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The User Account Object represents an instance of any type of user account,
including but not limited to operating system, device, messaging service,
and social media platform accounts.


=head2 METHODS

L<STIX::Observable::UserAccount> inherits all methods from L<STIX::Observable>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item STIX::Observable::UserAccount->new(%properties)

Create a new instance of L<STIX::Observable::UserAccount>.

=item $user_account->account_created

Specifies when the account was created.

=item $user_account->account_expires

Specifies the expiration date of the account.

=item $user_account->account_first_login

=item $user_account->account_last_login

Specifies the account login string, used in cases where the user_id
property specifies something other than what a user would type when they
login.

=item $user_account->account_type

Specifies the type of the account. This is an open vocabulary and values
SHOULD come from the account-type-ov vocabulary.

Specifies that the account has the ability to escalate privileges (i.e., in
the case of sudo on Unix or a Windows Domain Admin account).

=item $user_account->credential

Specifies a cleartext credential. This is only intended to be used in
capturing metadata from malware analysis (e.g., a hard-coded domain
administrator password that the malware attempts to use for lateral
movement) and SHOULD NOT be used for sharing of PII.

Specifies when the account credential was last changed.

process (daemon), not a specific individual.
