=head1 NAME

STIX::Observable::Extension::RasterImage - STIX Cyber-observable Object (SCO) - Raster Image File Extension

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use STIX::Observable::Extension::RasterImage;

    my $raster_image_ext = STIX::Observable::Extension::RasterImage->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Raster Image file extension specifies a default extension for
capturing properties specific to image files.

=head2 METHODS

L<STIX::Observable::Extension::RasterImage> inherits all methods from L<STIX::Base>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item STIX::Observable::Extension::RasterImage->new(%properties)

Create a new instance of L<STIX::Observable::Extension::RasterImage>.

=item $raster_image->image_height

Specifies the height of the image in the image file, in pixels.

=item $raster_image->image_width

Specifies the width of the image in the image file, in pixels.

=item $raster_image->bits_per_pixel

Specifies the sum of bits used for each color channel in the image in the image file,
and thus the total number of pixels used for expressing the color depth of the image.

=item $raster_image->exif_tags

Specifies the set of EXIF tags found in the image file, as a dictionary.
Each key/value pair in the dictionary represents the name/value of a single EXIF tag.

=item $raster_image_ext->to_string

Alias of L<TO_JSON>.
