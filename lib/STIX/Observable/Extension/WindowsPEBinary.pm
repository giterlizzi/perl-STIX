=head1 NAME

STIX::Observable::Extension::WindowsPEBinary - STIX Cyber-observable Object (SCO) - Raster Image File Extension

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use STIX::Observable::Extension::WindowsPEBinary;

    my $windows_pe_binary_ext = STIX::Observable::Extension::WindowsPEBinary->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Windows PE Binary File extension specifies a default extension for capturing
properties specific to Windows portable executable (PE) files.

=head2 METHODS

L<STIX::Observable::Extension::WindowsPEBinary> inherits all methods from L<STIX::Base>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item STIX::Observable::Extension::WindowsPEBinary->new(%properties)

Create a new instance of L<STIX::Observable::Extension::WindowsPEBinary>.

=item $windows_pe_binary_ext->pe_type

Specifies the type of the PE binary
(see C<WINDOWS_PEBINARY_TYPE> in L<STIX::Common::OpenVocabulary>). 

=item $windows_pe_binary_ext->imphash

Specifies the special import hash, or 'imphash', calculated for the PE Binary
based on its imported libraries and functions.

=item $windows_pe_binary_ext->machine_hex

Specifies the type of target machine.

=item $windows_pe_binary_ext->number_of_sections

Specifies the number of sections in the PE binary, as a non-negative integer.

=item $windows_pe_binary_ext->time_date_stamp

Specifies the time when the PE binary was created.  The timestamp value MUST BE
precise to the second.

=item $windows_pe_binary_ext->pointer_to_symbol_table_hex

Specifies the file offset of the COFF symbol table.

=item $windows_pe_binary_ext->number_of_symbols

Specifies the number of entries in the symbol table of the PE binary, as a
non-negative integer.

=item $windows_pe_binary_ext->size_of_optional_header

Specifies the size of the optional header of the PE binary.

=item $windows_pe_binary_ext->characteristics_hex

Specifies the flags that indicate the fileâ€™s characteristics.

=item $windows_pe_binary_ext->file_header_hashes

Specifies any hashes that were computed for the file header
(see L<STIX::Common::Hashes>).

=item $windows_pe_binary_ext->optional_header

Specifies the PE optional header of the PE binary
(see L<STIX::Observable::Type::WindowsPEOptionalHeader>).

=item $windows_pe_binary_ext->sections

Specifies metadata about the sections in the PE file
(see L<STIX::Observable::Type::WindowsPESection>).

=head2 HELPERS

=over

=item $windows_pe_binary_ext->TO_JSON

Convert L<STIX::Observable::Extension::WindowsPEBinary> in JSON.

=item $windows_pe_binary_ext->to_string

Alias of L<TO_JSON>.
