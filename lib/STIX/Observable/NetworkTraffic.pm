=head1 NAME

STIX::Observable::NetworkTraffic - STIX Cyber-observable Object (SCO) - Network Traffic

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use STIX::Observable::NetworkTraffic;

    my $network_traffic = STIX::Observable::NetworkTraffic->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Network Traffic Object represents arbitrary network traffic that
originates from a source and is addressed to a destination.


=head2 METHODS

L<STIX::Observable::NetworkTraffic> inherits all methods from L<STIX::Observable>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item STIX::Observable::NetworkTraffic->new(%properties)

Create a new instance of L<STIX::Observable::NetworkTraffic>.

=item $network_traffic->dst_byte_count

Specifies the number of bytes sent from the destination to the source.

=item $network_traffic->dst_packets

Specifies the number of packets sent destination to the source.

=item $network_traffic->dst_payload_ref

Specifies the bytes sent from the source to the destination.

=item $network_traffic->dst_port

Specifies the destination port used in the network traffic, as an integer.
The port value MUST be in the range of 0 - 65535.

=item $network_traffic->dst_ref

Specifies the destination of the network traffic, as a reference to an
Observable Object.

=item $network_traffic->encapsulated_by_ref

Links to another network-traffic object which encapsulates this object.

=item $network_traffic->encapsulates_refs

Links to other network-traffic objects encapsulated by a network-traffic.

=item $network_traffic->end

Specifies the date/time the network traffic ended, if known.

=item $network_traffic->extensions

The Network Traffic Object defines the following extensions. In addition to
these, producers MAY create their own. Extensions: http-ext, tcp-ext,
icmp-ext, socket-ext

=item $network_traffic->id

=item $network_traffic->ipfix

Specifies any IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) data for the traffic.

=item $network_traffic->protocols

Specifies the protocols observed in the network traffic, along with their
corresponding state.

=item $network_traffic->src_byte_count

Specifies the number of bytes sent from the source to the destination.

=item $network_traffic->src_packets

Specifies the number of packets sent from the source to the destination.

=item $network_traffic->src_payload_ref

Specifies the bytes sent from the source to the destination.

=item $network_traffic->src_port

Specifies the source port used in the network traffic, as an integer. The
port value MUST be in the range of 0 - 65535.

=item $network_traffic->src_ref

Specifies the source of the network traffic, as a reference to an
Observable Object.

=item $network_traffic->start

Specifies the date/time the network traffic was initiated, if known.

=item $network_traffic->type

The value of this property MUST be C<network-traffic>.

=back


=head2 HELPERS

=over

=item $network_traffic->TO_JSON

Convert L<STIX::Observable::NetworkTraffic> object in JSON.

=item $network_traffic->to_string

Alias of L<TO_JSON>.

=item $network_traffic->validate

Validate L<STIX::Observable::NetworkTraffic> object using JSON Schema
(see L<STIX::Schema>).
