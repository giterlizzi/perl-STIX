=head1 NAME

STIX::ObservedData - STIX Domain Object (SDO) - Observed Data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use STIX::ObservedData;

    my $observed_data = STIX::ObservedData->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Observed data conveys information that was observed on systems and
networks, such as log data or network traffic, using the Cyber Observable
specification.


=head2 METHODS

L<STIX::ObservedData> inherits all methods from L<STIX::Common::Properties>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item STIX::ObservedData->new(%properties)

Create a new instance of L<STIX::ObservedData>.

=item $observed_data->first_observed

The beginning of the time window that the data was observed during.

=item $observed_data->id

=item $observed_data->last_observed

The end of the time window that the data was observed during.

=item $observed_data->number_observed

The number of times the data represented in the objects property was
observed. This MUST be an integer between 1 and 999,999,999 inclusive.

=item $observed_data->object_refs

A list of SCOs and SROs representing the observation.

=item $observed_data->objects

A dictionary of Cyber Observable Objects that describes the single 'fact'
that was observed.

=item $observed_data->type

The type of this object, which MUST be the literal C<observed-data>.

=back


=head2 HELPERS

=over

=item $observed_data->TO_JSON

Convert L<STIX::ObservedData> object in JSON.

=item $observed_data->to_string

Alias of L<TO_JSON>.

=item $observed_data->validate

Validate L<STIX::ObservedData> object using JSON Schema (see L<STIX::Schema>).
